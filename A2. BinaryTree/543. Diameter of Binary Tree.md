###Diameter of Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/description/

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

**Example:**
Given a binary tree 

```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

```

Return **3**, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**Note:** The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.



* Solution quite similar to [124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum.md)

```java
class Solution {
    private class ResultType {
        int maxLength = 0;
        int singlePathLen = 0;
        
        ResultType(int maxLength, int singlePathLen) {
            this.maxLength = maxLength;
            this.singlePathLen = singlePathLen;
        }
    }
    
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        ResultType result = helper(root);
        return result.maxLength;
    }
    
    private ResultType helper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new ResultType(0, 0);
        }
        
        // Divide 
        ResultType left = helper(root.left);
        ResultType right = helper(root.right);
        
        // Conquer
        int singlePathLen = Math.max(left.singlePathLen, right.singlePathLen) + 1;
        
        int maxLength = Math.max(left.maxLength, right.maxLength);
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, left.singlePathLen + right.singlePathLen); // no need to + 1 !!!
        
        return new ResultType(maxLength, singlePathLen);
    }
}
```
