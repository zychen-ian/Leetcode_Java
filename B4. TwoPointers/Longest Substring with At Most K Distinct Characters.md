##Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

https://aaronice.gitbooks.io/lintcode/content/two_pointers/longest_substring_with_at_most_k_distinct_characters.html

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

**Example**

For example, Given s = `"eceba"`, `k = 3`,

T is `"eceb"` which its length is `4`.

**Challenge**

O(n), n is the size of the string s.



```java



```





##Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

Given a string S, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most two distinct characters.

For example, Given S = “eceba”, T is "ece" which its length is 3.



```java



```





##Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/

Find the length of the longest substring **T** of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in **T** appears no less than *k* times.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```





```java



```
