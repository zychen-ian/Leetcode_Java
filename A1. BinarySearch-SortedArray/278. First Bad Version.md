## First Bad Version

https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to **find the first bad version**. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.



* Revision numbers in SVN are incremental, e.g., 1->2->3->4->5
* Revision numbers in Git are hash number



**Method**: 

* find the <u>first position</u> of bad version
  * 1 2 3 4 **5** 6 7 8 
  * 0 0 0 0 X X X X 
* use the API `bool isBadVersion(version)`  as less as possible â€” ${O(log_2 n)}$

**Visualization**: 



```java
class Solution {
    /**
     * @param n: An integers.
     * @return: An integer which is the first bad version.
     */
    public int findFirstBadVersion(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return 0; // tech comm
        }
        int start = 1, end = n;
        while (start + 1 < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (SVNRepo.isBadVersion(mid)) {
                end = mid; // we find first element of bad version
            } else {
                start = mid;
            }
        }
            
        if (SVNRepo.isBadVersion(start)) { // start=bad, end=bad
            return start;
        } else if (SVNRepo.isBadVersion(end)) {
            return end; // start=notBad, end=bad
        } else {
            return 0; // tech comm
        }
    }
}
```
