##Sliding Window Maximum

https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/

Given an array *nums*, there is a sliding window of size *k* which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the *k* numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

For example,
Given *nums* = `[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]`, and *k* = 3.

```
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

```

Therefore, return the max sliding window as `[3,3,5,5,6,7]`.

**Note: **
You may assume *k* is always valid, ie: 1 ≤ k ≤ input array's size for non-empty array.

Could you solve it in linear time?



* Brute Force

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n - k; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
        ...
    }
}
O(n*k)
```

* Heap - MaxHashHeap
  * $O(nlog_2k)$
* Deque - 
  * $O(n)$ (需马上想起array, stack, queue, deque)
  * Non-increasing order (from Front to End)
  * End: Push/Pop
  * Front: Delete 
  * **Method**:
    1. add a number (add from end)
       1. May cause deletion (e.g., [7,5,3] add 8)
          1. [7,5,3,8] —> [7,5,8] —> [7,8] —> [8]
    2. delete a number (delete from front) using index
    3. get max from front (non-decreasing order)
    4. $O(n)$
       * Every element: add once & delete once $O(2n)$



```java




```
